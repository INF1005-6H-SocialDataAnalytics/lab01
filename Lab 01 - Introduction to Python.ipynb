    "# Lab 01 - Introduction to Python\n",
    "\n",
    "This lab is an introduction to Python, a programming language which can beused for not only social data analytical tasks, but also general interest programming, statistical analysis, and other data science-type tasks. Python is a language which has been around for over 10 years, has a vibrant community, and an open-source codebase. This means that if you have an issue with Python, there are many resources available for solving this issue.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Setup\n",
    "\n",
    "The version of Python we're using in this course is [Anaconda Python](https://www.continuum.io/downloads), Python 3.5 version. We're using this because there are many data science tools which come included automatically. We don't have to go through the trouble of installing anything else for what we plan to do.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can download this on your home computer or laptop if you'd like. For this class, we're going to use the version installed on the lab computers in DH 2010.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first thing you need to do is start the Anaconda Navigator, which is under the start menu in Windows. It will be in a different place on Mac, probably Applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Anaconda Navigator](img/00a-desktop.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "This will start a program which will give you a host of tools for writing Python code. For this class we will be using Jupyter Notebook, which is a way to put your code and notes about that code (called *documentation*) in the same file. The file you're looking at now was written in Jupyter Notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "Start the Jupyter Notebook by clicking Launch.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Jupyter Notebook](img/01a-jupyter.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "After that you will get a window which looks like this. It will list a bunch of files. You should click Desktop and use the dropdown menu to create a new folder. Call it Lab1.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Jupyter screen](img/02-jupyter-window.png)\n",
    "![Jupyter desktop](img/04a-jupyter-new-file.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "After that, enter the folder and create a new Python file by selecting **Python [Root]**. Once you do that, you should get a new screen which looks like this.\n",
    "\n",
    "![New file](img/05a-new-file.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Click the **Untitled** text and give the file a new name, such as Lab 1. \n",
    "\n",
    "![Title](img/06a-title.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Jupyter Notebooks work by operating on what are called *cells*. Those are the boxes which make up the notebook. A new cell will start with <code>In [ ]</code> and by default will take Python code. You can change the cell type by selecting content types in the center of the toolbar. For the first cell, let's selection type called *Markdown*. Markdown is a markup language which let's you create headers, lists, and emphasis. \n",
    "\n",
    "Try selecting Markdown, then entering the text <code># Lab 1</code>. This will be our title. Once you enter that, press the button in the toolbar which looks like a play button. This will *run* the cell.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Title2](img/07a-title2.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Now we're working. In the next box, we can start actually writing code. Let's do something easy. Type <code>1 + 1</code> in the box and press the Run Cell button.\n",
    "\n",
    "![1 + 1](img/08a-math.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "That's pretty much it when it comes to Jupyter Notebooks. Now, let's get to learning the mechanics of the Python programming language."
